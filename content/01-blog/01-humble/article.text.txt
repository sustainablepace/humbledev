There is something new to learn every day - and so much I don't know.

The more I learn the less I know - when you learn, dozens of new paths open up. 

This is why this blog is called __The humble developer__. 
We can't know everything. 
We can't even know a lot.

So I want to chronicle what I pick up along the way, because 

- writing things down helps me __focus__ and __understand__.
- we can __connect__ and have a shared learning experience. 
- I can __look up__ things I have forgotten.
- I can __give back__ to the web community.
