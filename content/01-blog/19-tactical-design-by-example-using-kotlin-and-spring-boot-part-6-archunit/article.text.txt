Today I experimented a little with ArchUnit, in order to validate that an application follows our team's interpretation of Hexagon Architecture. I wanted to ensure that

 - repositories, consumers and controllers are in the corresponding adapter package
 - application services are in the application service package
 - commands and queries are in the incoming port package
 - the outgoing port package only contains interfaces
 - the domain does not use any outer layers
 - the application services do not use any adapters

I started by watching a very nice introductory talk by Alexander Schwartz

He had a promising example for validating onion architectures (just another name for Hexagon Architectures), but more about that later. It is really simple to pull off.

## Example

### Test dependencies

First of all, you need to add ArchUnit as test dependencies

```kotlin
testImplementation("com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit5-api:0.14.1")
testImplementation("com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit5-engine:0.14.1")
```

### Test class

ArchUnit tests are, unsurprisingly, unit tests.

Here's a simple test class

```kotlin
@AnalyzeClasses(
    packages = ["com.rewe.digital.fulfillment.delivery.depositservice"],
    importOptions = [ImportOption.DoNotIncludeTests::class]
)
class ArchUnitTest {
}
```

Here I make sure that only classes in specified packages are tested, excluding test classes.

### Validating adapters

I want to make sure that all components that are repositories, Kafka consumers or controllers are in the corresponding adapter package.

```kotlin
@ArchTest
val `repositories are adapters` = ArchRuleDefinition.classes()
    .that().areAnnotatedWith(Repository::class.java)
    .should().resideInAPackage("..adapter.database..")

@ArchTest
val `controllers are adapters` = ArchRuleDefinition.classes()
    .that().areAnnotatedWith(Controller::class.java)
    .should().resideInAPackage("..adapter.http..")

@ArchTest
val `consumers are adapters` = ArchRuleDefinition.classes()
    .that().areAssignableTo(AbstractKafkaConsumer::class.java)
    .should().resideInAPackage("..adapter.kafka..")
```

The DSL makes it really easy to find the correct syntax. It's perfectly readable and offers a huge variety of options.

### Validating the application layer

We use a super class for commands, queries and application services.

```kotlin
@ArchTest
val `commands are incoming ports` = ArchRuleDefinition.classes()
    .that().areAssignableTo(Command::class.java)
    .should().resideInAPackage("..application.port.in..")

@ArchTest
val `queries are incoming ports`: ClassesShouldConjunction = ArchRuleDefinition.classes()
    .that().areAssignableTo(Query::class.java)
    .should().resideInAPackage("..application.port.in..")

@ArchTest
val `outgoing ports are always interfaces` = ArchRuleDefinition.classes()
    .that().resideInAPackage("..application.port.out..")
    .should().beInterfaces()

@ArchTest
val `application services are workflows` = ArchRuleDefinition.classes()
    .that().areAnnotatedWith(Service::class.java)
    .should().resideInAPackage("..application.service..")
    .andShould().beAssignableTo(Workflow::class.java)
```

### Validating the boundaries

And now we want to make sure that the boundaries are tight.

```kotlin
@ArchTest
val `hexagon architecture should be enforced` = Architectures.onionArchitecture()
    .domainModels("..domain..")
    .applicationServices("..application..")
    .adapter("adapter", "..adapter..")
    .withOptionalLayers(true)
```

I had to include _withOptionalLayers_ here because we don't use domain services in this example. Apparently ArchUnit expects every application to have Domain Services in a Hexagon Architecture.

Another thing: In the talk I mentioned above, this kind of validation is done "by hand", but when you check the source code of ArchUnit, the _onionArchitecture()_ method is merely syntactic sugar for _layeredArchitecture()_.

## Very good documentation, only one drawback

The documentation is impressively extensive. There are also a lot of helpful examples on GitHub.

A minor drawback is that IntelliJ IDEA is unable to execute a single ArchUnit test in a suite. You always have to execute all tests. Maybe upvote the issue and it will get fixed.

I liked the point in Alexander Schwartz' talk about watching the watchers - making sure that the tests actually validate what they promise. I started with red tests and fixed them, but I could definitely improve there.

In the end, I found ArchUnit really easy to use. It took me less than an hour to get it working, and I'm more of a clumsy guy.

I would like to hear if any of you are using it, and what architecture rules you are enforcing. Let me know! Just (link:https://twitter.com/sustainablepace text:contact me on Twitter).
