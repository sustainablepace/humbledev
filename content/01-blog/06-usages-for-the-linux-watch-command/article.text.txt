Today I learned about the `watch` command in Linux. It's a brilliant tool for command line monitoring. Basically, it just executes a command repeatedly and displays its output in a readable format.

## Examples ##

### Watch your wi-fi network traffic ###

```
watch ifconfig wlan0
```

### Watch free disk memory ###

```
watch free
```

### Watch a directory ###

For example when downloading files

```
watch ls -lt ~/Downloads
```

## Switches ##

Set the interval with `-n <seconds>` or omit the status line with `-t`. Like this

```
watch -t -n 1 ifconfig 
```
