You may be familiar with Jurgen Appelo's [Do-It-Yourself Team Values Kit](http://www.noop.nl/2009/10/the-do-it-yourself-team-values-kit.html). A few years ago I tried that with my team, and made a [german translation of the Big List of 50 Virtues](big-list-of-50-virtues-german/big-list-of-50-virtues-german.pdf). As the differences between the virtues are quite subtle, a translation helped my team make the most of it. Maybe you'll find it useful.
