Yesterday I wanted to find a maven dependency in my project, that itself depended on another dependency, which had a security issue and needed updating.

The command 

```
mvn dependency:tree
```

displays the whole dependency tree, but in a large project it takes a while to find what you're looking for. So I grepped the result

```
mvn dependency:tree | grep "<name>"
```

which confirmed the dependency was present, but not in which context. Fortunately there are the following switches 

- `-A <number>` : number of lines to be displayed __after__ the match
- `-B <number>` : number of lines to be displayed __before__ the match
- `-C <number>` : number of lines to be displayed __before and after__ the match

So I was able to find the dependency in my project with

```
mvn dependency:tree | grep "<name>" -B 10
```

If there is a better way to do this, let me know :)
