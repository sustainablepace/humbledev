I already wrote about the concept of the [Three Amigos](), this time I want to share a method to facilitate the refinement of __user stories__ and the creation of __acceptance criteria__, named __Example Mapping__.

The problem with getting user stories and acceptance criteria right is often that there is not enough collaboriation - just remember the Agile Principle

> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."

Example Mapping is an effective and playful way of solving this problem.

## Rules vs. Examples ##

There are different ways to describe acceptance criteria. While __rules__ are generalizations and by this often broad and ambiguous, __examples__ are specific and easy to understand. 

Often an underlying rule is not yet clear, while a single example is. The idea of Example Mapping is to create acceptance criteria for user stories by mapping rules to examples, in order to generate better rules and in general, questions that are not yet addressed in the story.

To me this is similar to natural sciences, where you have laws like the law of gravity, and you try to create tests so you can measure and get data to prove or refine the laws of nature.

## Example Mapping ##

You need index cards with four colours. Each card corresponds to an artifact

> GREEN    <-> Story
> YELLOW   <-> Rule
> BLUE     <-> Examples
> RED      <-> Questions

### Example ###
Imagine we were to design a machine that calculates the price of parking tickets at the airport. There could be different parking sites like

> Valet parking
> Short term parking
> Long-term parking

with each site having its own set of rules how a ticket price is calculated. For example,

Rules are what is needed for implementation, examples are for test cases, so you need both of them anyway.
