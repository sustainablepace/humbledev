I already wrote about the concept of the [Three Amigos](), this time I want to share a method to facilitate the refinement of __user stories__ and the creation of __acceptance criteria__, named __Example Mapping__.

The problem with getting user stories and acceptance criteria right is that often there is not enough collaboriation - just remember the Agile Principle

Example Mapping is an __effective__ and __playful__ way of solving this problem.

## Rules vs. Examples ##

There are different ways to describe acceptance criteria, rules or examples. While __rules__ are generalizations and by this often broad and ambiguous, __examples__ are specific and easy to understand. Often an underlying rule is not yet clear, while a single example is. 

## Example Mapping ##

The idea of Example Mapping is to create acceptance criteria for __user stories__ by mapping __examples__ to __rules__. By this, you generate better rules and in general, discover issues that are not yet addressed in the story. You write theses issues down as __questions__, they can trigger new rules, or are simple a token for deferring the issue.

You need index cards with four colours. Each card corresponds to one of the artifacts mentioned above

> GREEN    <-> Story
> YELLOW   <-> Rule
> BLUE     <-> Example
> RED      <-> Question

### Example ###

Imagine we were to design a machine that calculates the price of parking tickets at the airport. There could be different parking sites like

> Valet parking
> Short term parking
> Long-term parking

with each site having its own set of rules how a ticket price is calculated. 

When discussing the user story "as a user I want use valet parking in order to save time" (green card), the product owner would for example explain that the price is 6€ for the first hour (first yellow card), with a maximum of 18€ per day (second yellow card).

The first obvious example would be parking for 5 hours (blue card), with a price of 6€, and a blue card for parking a little longer than five hours (another blue card), with a price of 18€. 

The amigos would also ask about the pricing for overnight parking, as it spans two days. The product owner would realize that the rules needed refinement, and would replace _day_ by _24 hours_. And it would yield in more blue cards, parking for exactly 24 hours and slightly longer than 24 hours.

Maybe the amigos (most likely the tester) would address more edge cases, like daylight savings time), which would produce even more blue cards.

Rules are what is needed for implementation, examples are for test cases, so you need both of them anyway.
To me this is similar to natural sciences, where you have laws like the law of gravity, and you try to create tests so you can measure and get data to prove or refine the laws of nature.
